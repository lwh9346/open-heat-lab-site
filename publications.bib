	abstract = {The ultrahigh thermal conductivity of cubic boron arsenide ({BAs}) makes it a promising material for next-generation electronics and optoelectronics. Here, we report measured optical properties of {BAs} crystals, including the complex dielectric function, refractive index, and absorption coefficient in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared wavelength range. The data were collected at room temperature using spectroscopic ellipsometry and transmission and reflection spectroscopy. We further calculated the optical response using density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory, considering quasiparticle and excitonic corrections. The computed values for the direct and indirect bandgaps (4.25 {eV} and 2.07 {eV}) agree well with the measured results (4.12 {eV} and 2.02 {eV}). Our findings pave the way for using {BAs} in future electronic and optoelectronic applications that take advantage of its demonstrated ultrahigh thermal conductivity and predicted high ambipolar carrier mobility.},

	abstract = {Traditional polymers are both electrically and thermally insulating. The development of electrically conductive polymers has led to novel applications such as flexible displays, solar cells, and wearable biosensors. As in the case of electrically conductive polymers, the development of polymers with high thermal conductivity would open up a range of applications in next-generation electronic, optoelectronic, and energy devices. Current research has so far been limited to engineering polymers either by strong intramolecular interactions, which enable efficient phonon transport along the polymer chains, or by strong intermolecular interactions, which enable efficient phonon transport between the polymer chains. However, it has not been possible until now to engineer both interactions simultaneously. We report the first realization of high thermal conductivity in the thin film of a conjugated polymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene), via bottom-up oxidative chemical vapor deposition ({oCVD}), taking advantage of both strong C=C covalent bonding along the extended polymer chain and strong π-π stacking noncovalent interactions between chains. We confirm the presence of both types of interactions by systematic structural characterization, achieving a near–room temperature thermal conductivity of 2.2 W/m·K, which is 10 times higher than that of conventional polymers. With the solvent-free {oCVD} technique, it is now possible to grow polymer films conformally on a variety of substrates as lightweight, flexible heat conductors that are also electrically insulating and resistant to corrosion.

Various approaches to modeling near-field thermal transport are briefly discussed, together with key results and proposals for manipulation and utilization of radiative heat flow. Subsequently, we review the experimental advances in the characterization of both near-field heat flow and energy density.

The thermal impedance of the interposer was introduced, which was taken to be the product of the steady-state thermal resistance and a complex ratio function. A complete expression for the thermal impedance of the interposer was derived, and the effects of the radiation heat loss as well as the deviation of the contact junction position were theoretically estimated. A microscale Pt wire with two interposers was measured, including solidified platinum black and Apiezon N vacuum grease. Experimental results showed that the platinum black contact with high thermal effusivity served as a negative thermal impedance, while a positive thermal impedance was observed for the Apiezon N contact. The obtained thermal impedance of the Apiezon N contact could be equivalent to its thermal resistance, which was verified by measuring the thermal conductivity of a Cu wire using the steady-state T-type probe.},

Here, we report on a novel platform, with an integrated reflected light microscope, that is capable of parallelizing two planar surfaces such that the angular deviation is {\textless}6 μrad, while simultaneously allowing control of the gap from 15 μm down to contact with ∼0.15 nm resolution. The capabilities of this platform were verified by using two custom-fabricated micro-devices with planar surfaces, 60 × 60 μm2 each, whose flatness and surface roughness were experimentally quantified. We first parallelized the two micro-devices by using the developed platform in conjunction with a simple optical approach that relies on the shallow depth of field (∼2 μm) of a long working distance microscope objective. Subsequently, we experimentally tested the parallelism achieved via the optical alignment procedure by taking advantage of electrodes integrated into the micro-devices. Our measurements unambiguously show that the simple depth-of-field based optical approach enables parallelization such that the angular deviation between the two surfaces is within ∼500 μrad. This ensures that the separation between any two corresponding points on the parallel surfaces deviate by ∼30 nm or less from the expected value. Further, we show that improved parallelization can be achieved using the integrated micro-electrodes which enable surface roughness limited parallelization with deviations of ∼5 nm from parallelism.},

	abstract = {Graphite gets a second sound
Between the two extremes of ballistic and diffusive lattice thermal transport is the potential for an exotic wave-like state known as second sound. Huberman et al. used fast, transient thermal grating measurements to show the existence of second sound in graphite between 85 and 125 kelvin (see the Perspective by Shi). Previous observations of second sound have been rare, confined to isotopically pure materials at very low temperatures. The observation of second sound in graphite is likely due to its layered nature, suggesting that this thermal transport mode may be accessible in other two-dimensional materials.
Science, this issue p. 375; see also p. 332
Wavelike thermal transport in solids, referred to as second sound, is an exotic phenomenon previously limited to a handful of materials at low temperatures. The rare occurrence of this effect restricted its scientific and practical importance. We directly observed second sound in graphite at temperatures above 100 kelvins by using time-resolved optical measurements of thermal transport on the micrometer-length scale. Our experimental results are in qualitative agreement with ab initio calculations that predict wavelike phonon hydrodynamics. We believe that these results potentially indicate an important role of second sound in microscale transient heat transport in two-dimensional and layered materials in a wide temperature range.
Second sound was observed in highly oriented pyrolytic graphite.

	abstract = {Nondiffusive phonon thermal transport, extensively observed in nanostructures, has largely been attributed to classical size effects, ignoring the wave nature of phonons. We report localization behavior in phonon heat conduction due to multiple scattering and interference events of broadband phonons, by measuring the thermal conductivities of {GaAs}/{AlAs} superlattices with {ErAs} nanodots randomly distributed at the interfaces. With an increasing number of superlattice periods, the measured thermal conductivities near room temperature increased and eventually saturated, indicating a transition from ballistic to diffusive transport. In contrast, at cryogenic temperatures the thermal conductivities first increased but then decreased, signaling phonon wave localization, as supported by atomistic Greenșs function simulations. The discovery of phonon localization suggests a new path forward for engineering phonon thermal transport.

	abstract = {Since Peierls's pioneering work, it is generally accepted that phonon-phonon scattering processes consist of momentum-conserving normal scatterings and momentum-destroying Umklapp scatterings, and that the latter always induce thermal resistance. We show in this work that Umklapp scatterings are not necessarily resistive—no thermal resistance is induced if the projected momentum is conserved in the direction of heat flow. This distinction is especially important in anisotropic materials such as graphite and black phosphorous. By introducing a direction-dependent definition of normal and Umklapp scattering, we can model thermal transport in anisotropic materials using the Callaway model accurately. This accuracy is physically rooted in the improved description of mode-specific phonon dynamics. With the new definition, we predict that second sound might persist over much longer distances than previously expected.},

	abstract = {Moving the heat aside with {BAs}
Thermal management becomes increasingly important as we decrease device size and increase computing power. Engineering materials with high thermal conductivity, such as boron arsenide ({BAs}), is hard because it is essential to avoid defects and impurities during synthesis, which would stop heat flow. Three different research groups have synthesized {BAs} with a thermal conductivity around 1000 watts per meter-kelvin: Kang et al., Li et al., and Tian et al. succeeded in synthesizing high-purity {BAs} with conductivities half that of diamond but more than double that of conventional metals (see the Perspective by Dames). The advance validates the search for high-thermal-conductivity materials and provides a new material that may be more easily integrated into semiconducting devices.
Science, this issue p. 575, p. 579, p. 582; see also p. 549
Conventional theory predicts that ultrahigh lattice thermal conductivity can only occur in crystals composed of strongly bonded light elements, and that it is limited by anharmonic three-phonon processes. We report experimental evidence that departs from these long-held criteria. We measured a local room-temperature thermal conductivity exceeding 1000 watts per meter-kelvin and an average bulk value reaching 900 watts per meter-kelvin in bulk boron arsenide ({BAs}) crystals, where boron and arsenic are light and heavy elements, respectively. The high values are consistent with a proposal for phonon-band engineering and can only be explained by higher-order phonon processes. These findings yield insight into the physics of heat conduction in solids and show {BAs} to be the only known semiconductor with ultrahigh thermal conductivity.
Boron arsenide has an ultrahigh thermal conductivity, making it competitive with diamond for thermal management applications.

	abstract = {This paper deals with the systematic and quantitative robustness analysis of solutions to the volume-to-point ({VP}) heat conduction optimization problem, including solutions by constructal theory ({CT}), bionic optimization ({BO}), simulated annealing ({SA}) as well as random solutions. The impacts of both load-induced and random failures are examined. All the solutions behave similarly during a failure. A tiny high-heat-flux-induced failure causes huge performance loss, which is the worst possible case. While the best case is a failure at positions of low heat flux, a large amount of which only causes a small performance loss. Random failure generally results in a loss roughly linear with failure amount, but sudden loss increase happens. Both intuitive and practical definitions of robustness are considered. Intuitively, a performance-robustness trade-off is seen for all the solutions, with poorer solutions being robuster. Practically things are different, with {SA} solutions both the best in performance and the robustest during a failure in the worst case. However, {CT} and {BO} solutions turn out to be robuster than {SA} solution in the best case, and {CT} solution may be more preferable in practice due to its regular geometry. With robustness taken into consideration, different solutions could be evaluated more comprehensively, the critical aspects concerning the practical realization of the solutions are also revealed, and furthermore the significance of robustness analysis in general {VP} problems is accentuated.},

	abstract = {In the hydrodynamic regime, phonons drift with a nonzero collective velocity under a temperature gradient, reminiscent of viscous gas and fluid flow. The study of hydrodynamic phonon transport has spanned over half a century but has been mostly limited to cryogenic temperatures (∼1 K) and more recently to low-dimensional materials. Here, we identify graphite as a three-dimensional material that supports phonon hydrodynamics at significantly higher temperatures (∼100 K) based on first-principles calculations. In particular, by solving the Boltzmann equation for phonon transport in graphite ribbons, we predict that phonon Poiseuille flow and Knudsen minimum can be experimentally observed above liquid nitrogen temperature. Further, we reveal the microscopic origin of these intriguing phenomena in terms of the dependence of the effective boundary scattering rate on momentum-conserving phonon–phonon scattering processes and the collective motion of phonons. The significant hydrodynamic nature of phonon transport in graphite is attributed to its strong intralayer sp2 hybrid bonding and weak van der Waals interlayer interactions. More intriguingly, the reflection symmetry associated with a single graphene layer is broken in graphite, which opens up more momentum-conserving phonon–phonon scattering channels and results in stronger hydrodynamic features in graphite than graphene. As a boundary-sensitive transport regime, phonon hydrodynamics opens up new possibilities for thermal management and energy conversion.},

Thermal management of electronics requires materials that can efficiently remove heat. Several promising materials have been found recently, but diamond remains the bulk material with the highest thermal conductivity. Chen et al. found that isotopically pure cubic boron nitride has an ultrahigh thermal conductivity, 75\% that of diamond. Using only boron-11 or boron-10 allows the crystal vibrations that carry heat to move more efficiently through the material. This property could be exploited for better regulating the temperature of high-power devices.
Science, this issue p. 555
Materials with high thermal conductivity (κ) are of technological importance and fundamental interest. We grew cubic boron nitride ({cBN}) crystals with controlled abundance of boron isotopes and measured κ greater than 1600 watts per meter-kelvin at room temperature in samples with enriched 10B or 11B. In comparison, we found that the isotope enhancement of κ is considerably lower for boron phosphide and boron arsenide as the identical isotopic mass disorder becomes increasingly invisible to phonons. The ultrahigh κ in conjunction with its wide bandgap (6.2 electron volts) makes {cBN} a promising material for microelectronics thermal management, high-power electronics, and optoelectronics applications.
Isotopically pure cubic boron nitride has a thermal conductivity almost as high as that of diamond.

While much progress has been made in uncovering how phonons affect electron dynamics, it remains a challenge to directly observe the impact of electrons on phonon transport, especially at environmental temperatures. Here, we probe the effect of charge carriers on phonon heat transport at room temperature, using a modified transient thermal grating technique. By optically exciting electron-hole pairs in a crystalline silicon membrane, we single out the effect of the phonon–carrier interaction. The enhanced phonon scattering by photoexcited free carriers results in a substantial reduction in thermal conductivity on a nanosecond timescale. Our study provides direct experimental evidence of the elusive role of electron–phonon interaction in phonon heat transport, which is important for understanding heat conduction in doped semiconductors. We also highlight the possibility of using light to dynamically control thermal transport via electron–phonon coupling.},

Further, we identify special angles leading to heat flow extrema, which are dictated by the Drude weight in the intraband optical conductivity of {TBLG}, and are roughly linear with the chemical potential. As the twist angle decreases, we observe multiband thermal transport due to the increasing role of interband transitions, in analogy to monolayer graphene in a magnetic field.

To demonstrate, we realize such a scenario by matching thin films of metal-to-insulator transition materials and polar dielectrics in the near field. By leveraging the distinct scaling behaviors of the local density of states with film thickness for metals and insulators, we theoretically achieve rectification ratios over 140, a 10-fold improvement over the state of the art, with nanofilms of vanadium dioxide and cubic boron nitride in the parallel-plane geometry at experimentally feasible gap sizes (∼100 nm). Our rational design offers relative ease of fabrication, flexible choice of materials, and robustness against deviations from optimal film thicknesses. We expect this work to facilitate the application of thermal diodes in solid-state thermal circuits and energy-conversion devices.},

In particular, a proper band gap value (∼1.85 {eV}) combined with a large carrier mobility makes {BAs} a potential photoelectrode material for solar energy harvesting. In this work, we employ spin-polarized density functional theory calculations to investigate the possibility of using surface-functionalized {BAs} as a photocathode for solar-driven {CO}2 reduction. With a focus on the {BAs} (110) facet in aqueous solution, we first examine the band-edge positions and show a large thermodynamic driving force for {CO}2 reduction by photoexcited electrons from the conduction band. We further study the catalytic activity of {BAs} functionalized with a cocatalyst, pyridine (Py), by describing the reaction pathway of a hydride-transfer process from adsorbed 2-pyridinide (2-{PyH}–*, a Py-derived catalytic intermediate) to {CO}2. We find that both the 2-{PyH}–* formation and the {CO}2 reduction step are thermodynamically and kinetically favorable and predict that Py-functionalized {BAs} is a promising candidate for heterogeneous {CO}2 photoreduction.},

Here, by employing a rational-design approach based on the electromagnetic local density of states, we demonstrate the ability of {HMMs} to substantially rectify radiative heat flow. Our idea is to establish a forward-biased scenario where the two {HMM}-based terminals of a thermal diode feature overlapped hyperbolic bands which result in a large heat current, and suppress the reverse heat flow by creating spectrally mismatched density of states as the temperature bias is flipped. As an example, we present a few high-performance thermal diodes by pairing {HMMs} made of polar dielectrics and metal-to-insulator transition materials in the form of periodic nanowire arrays, and considering three representative kinds of substrates. Upon optimization, we theoretically achieve a rectification ratio of 324 at a 100-nm gap, which remains greater than 148 for larger gap sizes up to 1 µm over a wide temperature range. The maximum rectification represents an almost 1000-fold increase compared with a bulk diode using the same materials, and is twice that of state-of-the-art designs.

This strong {EPID} coupling can significantly suppress the thermal conductivity in wurtzite zinc oxide, which originates from the absence of a mirror plane perpendicular to the c-axis that breaks the inversion symmetry of the out-of-plane vibrational modes. In contrast, such an effect does not occur in the zinc-blende gallium arsenide because no piezoelectric field can be generated along the three principal axes. This work highlights the effect of centrosymmetry breaking on tailoring phonon transport in polar semiconductors.},

The experimentally determined dispersion relation of the thermal-wave velocity increases with decreasing grating period, consistent with first-principles-based solution of the Peierls-Boltzmann transport equation. Through simulation, we reveal this increase as a result of thermal zero sound—the thermal waves due to ballistic phonons. Our experimental findings are well explained with the interplay among three groups of phonons: ballistic, diffusive, and hydrodynamic phonons. Our ab initio calculations further predict a large isotope effect on the properties of thermal waves and the existence of second sound at room temperature in isotopically pure graphite.},

However, despite decades of extensive research, large rectiﬁcation ratios of practical importance have yet to be demonstrated. Here, we theoretically achieve giant rectiﬁcation ratios (3 to almost 5 orders of magnitude) by leveraging nearﬁeld radiative thermal transport between two parallel planes. Guided by a rational design approach centering on the electromagnetic local density of states ({LDOS}), we employ a thin ﬁlm of an intrinsic semiconductordsuch as silicondas one terminal of our radiative thermal diodes, which provides the necessary nonlinearity and a substantial {LDOS} contrast as the temperature bias is ﬂipped. For the other terminal, we explore two kinds of materials which either serve as a narrowband or a broadband ﬁlter, both capable of converting the large {LDOS} contrast into giant thermal rectiﬁcation. We further consider representative multilayer conﬁgurations in order to block backside radiation and improve mechanical stability. All the designs are expected to perform well over a wide range of ﬁlm thicknesses, gap sizes, and temperatures.

Here, we present a theoretical study of near-ﬁeld thermal radiation between suspended {TBLG} with a focus on the magic angle. Within the chirally symmetric continuum model, we observe a suppressed heat ﬂow when approaching the magic angle owing to a reduced Drude weight, with greater suppressions at lower temperatures and larger gap sizes. When the chemical potential lies in the energy gap near the charge neutrality point, more than 100-fold heat-ﬂow variation can be achieved at 50 K within 0.25  of twist. By reducing the electron scattering rate, the radiation spectrum near the magic angle dramatically narrows, leading to over 10,000-fold of suppression. In addition, supported {TBLG} is brieﬂy considered to facilitate experimental measurement. With rationally tailored substrates, the heat-ﬂow contrast can still exceed 1000. We also discuss lattice relaxation effect in terms of the interlayer coupling energy, ﬁnding that a stronger coupling leads to a smaller heat-ﬂow contrast and more prominent multiband transport. Our results highlight the great potential of magic-angle {TBLG} in thermal transport, especially for controlling thermal radiation.},

We show that between 800 and 950 K, the in-plane and cross-plane thermal conductivity has an average decrease of 38\% and 19\%, respectively, when four-phonon scatterings are considered.

Here, by employing a systematic numerical study, we present a highly-efficient embedded single-phase water-cooled silicon heat sink featuring a manifold with interdigitated inlets and outlets and jet microchannels with sawtooth side walls. Compared to straight channels, the sawtooth walls reduce blockage of the jet inflow and therefore the pressure drop. Meanwhile, the sawtooth profile helps suppress the large recirculation region around the jet inlet and generate small vortices near the channel walls which facilitate fluid mixing and enhance heat exchange. This simultaneous enhancement of heat transfer and reduction of pressure drop leads to some of the highest cooling efficiencies. In particular, for a 3 × 3 mm2 chip at a temperature rise of 60 K, dissipation of heat fluxes over 2100 W cm−2 is possible with a pumping power of about 1.3 W cm−2. For heat fluxes around 1000 W cm−2, the coefficient of performance can reach beyond 20,000.

In this work, we study the pressure-dependent thermal conductivity (up to 20 {GPa}) of isotope-engineered c-{BN} by solving the Boltzmann transport equation with inputs only from ab initio calculations. Four boron isotope compositions are analyzed, including natural abundance, enriched 10B and 11B, and a roughly equal mixture of the two. In all cases, the thermal conductivity of c-{BN} increases linearly with pressure. Compared to isotope-enriched c-{BN}, the thermal conductivity of isotopically mixed c-{BN} is less sensitive to pressure variations since phonon-isotope scattering causes substantial thermal resistance yet is pressure independent. Based on mode-resolved analysis, the thermal conductivity enhancement is mainly attributed to the suppression of the aao absorption processes with transverse-acoustic phonons in the frequency range from 300 to 600 cm–1, due to the synergistic effect between decreased coupling strength and phonon hardening. In addition, suppression of the aaa processes is also responsible for a slight increase in thermal conductivity. Our results are further supported by the frequency- and mean-free-path-dependent spectra of the thermal conductivity. This work provided a fundamental interpretation of pressure-dependent phonon transport in c-{BN} from a microscopic perspective.},

Based on fluctuational electrodynamics, we theoretically demonstrate that for thermal diodes pairing thin films of intrinsic silicon (i-Si) and lithium hydride ({LiX}), the rectification ratio can increase by over six times with varying isotopic compositions. This is because by leveraging the isotope-induced shift and broadening of the surface phonon polaritons in {LiX}, more {LDOS} contrast provided by i-Si can be effectively converted into thermal rectification. Moreover, we show that such improvement is fairly robust, as evidenced by the prediction of over 20\% rectification enhancement across a wide physical and geometric parameter space. Finally, inspired by insights from the i-Si-based thermal diodes, we propose general guidelines for implementing isotope engineering in the design of practical devices, which are further illustrated via representative diodes employing vanadium dioxide and silicon carbide as the active materials.

	abstract = {Isotopic dependence of the Casimir force is key to probing new physics and pushing novel technologies at the micro and nanoscale, but is largely unexplored. In 2002, an isotope effect of 10$^{\textrm{−4}}$ was estimated for metals—orders of magnitude beyond the experimental resolution. Here, by employing the Lifshitz theory, we reveal a significant isotope effect of over 10$^{\textrm{−1}}$ for polar dielectrics. This effect arises from the isotope-mass-induced line shift of the zone-center optical phonons and is insensitive to the linewidth. We perform numerical analyses on both the imaginary and real-frequency axes, and derive analytical formulas for predicting the isotope effect. The three-orders-of-magnitude difference between polar dielectrics and metals arises from the distinct isotopic dependence of the phonon and plasma frequencies. Our work opens up a new avenue for engineering forces at small scales and may also facilitate the quest for the fifth force of nature.},

	abstract = {Recent measurements of near-field radiative heat transfer ({NFRHT}) between objects separated by nanometer-sized vacuum gaps have revealed that thermal radiation at the nanoscale is remarkably distinct from far-field thermal radiation and can exceed the blackbody radiation limit by orders of magnitude. Given the technological relevance of thin films, there remains a significant need to experimentally explore how such films influence {NFRHT}. Here, we report direct measurements of the thickness-dependence of {NFRHT} between planar nanofilms of magnesium fluoride (thickness ranging from 20 to 500 nm) performed using microfabricated devices and a custom-developed nanopositioner. These results directly demonstrate for the first time that nanofilms can enhance thermal radiation up to 800-fold above the blackbody limit and are as effective as bulk materials when nanoscale gaps have dimensions smaller than the film thickness. Finally, calculations based on fluctuational electrodynamics show good agreement with the measured gap-size dependence of the heat transfer coefficient for films of all thicknesses and provide physical insight into the observed dependence. The experimental techniques and insights reported here pave the way for systematically exploring novel thin films for near-field thermal and energy systems.},

	abstract = {To efficiently remove the increasingly higher heat fluxes from electronic chips, this numerical study presents an embedded single-phase water-cooled heat sink which consists of a microchannel layer and a jet-enhanced {HU}-type manifold layer. The manifold features two liquid inlet plenums symmetrically positioned on two opposite sides and some outlets arranged in the middle. In order to reduce the average thermal resistance, the fluid impinging velocity is boosted by narrowing the manifold channel inlet. However, narrower inlet also leads to flow maldistribution which increases the maximum thermal resistance. To address this problem, we demonstrate two approaches: either adding a flat plate at the manifold outlet or adjusting the manifold channel walls to form a tapered pathway. Further, the impact of the plenum and manifold channel inlet profiles on fluid flow and heat transfer is investigated. Negligible difference is found between rectangular and trapezoidal plenums. As to the manifold channel inlet, although similar heat transfer performance is obtained with different shapes, the total pressure drop can be substantially different. To reduce the large pressure drop at the inlet, a semicircular or triangular inlet profile is preferred, instead of a rectangular one. Quantitatively, we show that for a 3 × 3 mm2 heated area, our heat sink can dissipate fluxes up to 2000 W cm−2 with a maximum temperature rise of 65 K and a pressure drop below 40 {kPa}, which represents one of the highest performances and energy efficiencies reported to date.},

	abstract = {Among two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides, molybdenum ditelluride ({MoTe}2) is of great interest to achieving unique functionalities in diverse electronic, photonic, and phononic devices. Despite extensive studies over the past decade, the thermal transport properties and mechanisms of {MoTe}2 remain largely unclear. Here, we grow few-layer (7L, 10L, and 17L) single-crystalline 2H–{MoTe}2 and measure their in-plane thermal conductivities using an optothermal Raman technique. The room-temperature values range from 4 to 9 W m−1 K−1, substantially lower than theoretical predictions considering only three-phonon scattering. By employing first-principles calculations and machine learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal that four-phonon scattering could suppress the thermal conductivity of 2H–{MoTe}2 by 80\%, which agrees with experimental measurement and is mainly attributed to the flexural acoustic modes. Thickness-dependent suppression is observed owing to the varying reflection symmetry. Our work highlights higher-order phonon-phonon interactions in 2D materials and offers guidance for the thermal design of emerging devices.},

Here, we develop a uniﬁed neural network interatomic potential with quantum-mechanical precision that accurately describes phonon transport properties in both perfect and defective boron arsenides. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we quantitatively explore the degree of phonon localization in boron arsenide caused by arsenic vacancies. We conﬁrm that this localization primarily affects vibration modes within the frequency range of 2.0–4.0 {THz}, which is a challenge for conventional ﬁrst-principles approaches. In addition, we examine the ﬂuctuation of the heat ﬂux autocorrelation function, which reveals the extent of phonon phase disruption resulting from arsenic voids and lattice anharmonicity from a more fundamental perspective. Our study highlights the applicability of molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with neural network interatomic potential for defective systems, laying the theoretical groundwork for phonon engineering in real semiconductor crystals.},

	abstract = {We investigate phonon transport in consecutively twisted multilayer graphene ({CTMG}) via atomistic simulations, assuming the same twist angle between any adjacent layers. Intriguingly, the calculated temperature drop be­ tween each two layers along the cross-plane direction in {CTMG} appears nearly identical, indicating an ill-defined Kapitza length. Moreover, the bulk-like thermal resistance increases with rising temperature. Both phenomena suggest that heat conduction in {CTMG} more closely resembles that in bulk materials as compared to layered materials with an individual mismatched interface, such as twisted multilayer graphene ({TMG}). This peculiar behavior originates from the unique nanostructure of {CTMG}. First, the common twist angle creates a consistent charge distribution at each interface, leading to a higher binding energy and reduced mismatch of the phonon density of states across the interface, and therefore a more uniform temperature drop. Further, the continuum of interfaces induces strong scattering of low-energy acoustic phonons generated by emission processes at the in­ terfaces, which results in a temperature dependence opposite to that of {TMG}. Our findings enable a better un­ derstanding of phonon transport in twisted multilayer graphene, and may also facilitate the exploration of other interface-engineered van der Waals nanostructures.},
